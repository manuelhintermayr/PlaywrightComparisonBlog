## Introduction

Playwright is a powerful automation library that enables developers to automate web browser interactions across different browser engines. This repository showcases how to write tests using Playwright in TypeScript, Java, C#, and Python.
This repo was written for a blog.

## Test Example

The test example, named `TestExample`, demonstrates common web automation scenarios, such as clicking a button, checking a checkbox, and searching on Wikipedia. Each language variant implements the same set of tests using their respective syntax and conventions.

## Usage

To run the tests for each language variant, follow the instructions provided in their respective directories:

- **PlaywrightTS**: TypeScript variant using Playwright TypeScript.
